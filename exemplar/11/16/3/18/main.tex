A non-leap year has a total of 365 days, and a week has 7 days.\\
So it can be expressed as 
\begin{align}
365\text{days} &=52\times 7+1 \text{day}
\end{align}
$\implies$ 52 tuesdays or wednesdays\\
Random variable X denotes the days of a week
\begin{align}
p_X\brak{k}&=\frac{1}{7}; \quad \brak{1<k<7}
\end{align}
So the probability of extra day being tuesday or wednesday is
\begin{align}
p_X\brak{3}+p_X\brak{4}&=\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{7}=\frac{2}{7}
\end{align}
