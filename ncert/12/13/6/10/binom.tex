If $n$ be the number of coin tosses, the distribution is $X \sim \bnm{n}{\frac{1}{2}}$, where $X$ represents the number of heads.  The given probability is 
\begin{align}
\pr{X\geq1} > 0.9 \\
\implies 1 - p_{X}(0) > 0.9\\
\text{or, }\brak{2}^n > 10
\\
\therefore n>\log_2(10)\\
\implies n > 3.32 \implies n = 4,
\end{align}
Since $n$ is a positive integer.
