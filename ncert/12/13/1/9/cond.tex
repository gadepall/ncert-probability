		The total ways of arranging Father, Son, Mother in the family chart is 3! = 6.
The probability that Father in middle is
\begin{align}
\pr{F} &= \frac{2!}{3!}
= \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
The probability that Father in middle and Son is on one end is
\begin{align}
\pr{EF} = \frac{2!}{3!}
= \frac{1}{3}
\end{align}
	Thus,	
\begin{align}
\pr{E \mid F}=\frac{\pr{EF}}{\pr{F}} 
= 1
\end{align}
