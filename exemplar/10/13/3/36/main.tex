Let 
\begin{align}
	 X_1 =
	\begin{cases}
		1, & \text{if bulb is not defective}\\ 
		0, & \text{if bulb is defective}
	\end{cases}
\end{align}
Then the Bernoulli parameter 
\begin{align}
	p_1 = 1 - \frac{6}{24}
               =\frac{3}{4}          
\end{align}
which is the desired probability.  In the second case, 
\begin{align}
1-p_2 = \frac{6-1}{24-1}
=\frac{5}{23}
\end{align}
which is the desired probability.
