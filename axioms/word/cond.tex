	\item Assume that the chances of a patient having a heart attack is $40\%$. It is also assumed that a meditation and yoga course reduce the risk of heart attack by $30\%$ and prescription of certain drug reduces its chances by $25\%$. At a time a patient can choose any one of the two options with equal probabilities. It is given that after going through one of the two options the patient selected at random suffers a heart attack. Find the probability that the patient followed a course of meditation and yoga.
