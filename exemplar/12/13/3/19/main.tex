Let $X_i, i = 1,2,3,4$ denote a king in the $i$th draw.
Then,
\begin{align}
	\pr{X_{1}}=\frac{4}{52},\
\pr{X_{2}|X_{1}} =\frac{3}{51},\
	\pr{X_{3}|X_{2}X_{1}}=\frac{2}{50},\
	\pr{X_{4}|X_{1}X_{2}X_{3}} =\frac{1}{49}
	\\
	\implies \pr{X_{1}X_{2}X_{3}X_{4}}  
                                     = \frac{4}{52} \times \frac{3}{51} \times \frac{2}{50} \times \frac{1}{49} \\
                                     = \frac{1}{270725}
\end{align}
which is the desired probability.
