Given that 
\begin{align}
\pr{AB} = \pr{A}\pr{B}
\end{align}
If $A^{\prime}$  and $B^{\prime}$ are independent,
\begin{align}
	\pr{A^{\prime} B^{\prime}} &= \pr{A+B}^{\prime}
	=1 - \pr{A+B}
	\\
	&= 1 - \pr{A}-
	 - \pr{B} +  \pr{AB}
	 \\
	&= 1 - \pr{A}-
	 - \pr{B} +  \pr{A}\pr{B}
	 \\
	&= \sbrak{1 - \pr{A}}
	\sbrak{ 1 - \pr{B}}  
	\\
	&=
\pr{A^{\prime}} 
\pr{B^{\prime}} 
\end{align}
Hence, $A^{\prime}$ and $B^{\prime}$ are also independent. 
Therefore, the given statement is true.
