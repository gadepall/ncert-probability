Assignment 1: Question 12.13.2.12

The total number of possible cases is counted by the variable 'count'.
The number of required outcomes is counted by the variable 'c'.
The probability is calculated by the variable 'p'.

Total number of outcomes is 216.
Number of possible outcomes is 27.

The probability of atleast one odd number occuring is equal to (1 - Probability of all observations being even).

Probability of all three observations being even = c/count
Probability of atleast one observation being odd = 1 - (c/count)

Therefore, the required probability is 0.875.
