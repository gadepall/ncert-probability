\item All the jacks, queens and kings are removed from a deck of 52 playing cards. The remaining cards are well shuffled and then one card is drawn at random. Giving ace a value 1 similar value for other cards, find the probability that the card has a value

	\item 7
	\item greater than 7
	\item less than 7

\item Two dice are numbered 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 1,1,2,2,3,3 respectively. They are thrown and the sum of then numbers on them is noted. Find the probability of getting each sum from 2 to 9 seperately

\item A game of chance consists of spinning an arrow
which comes to rest pointing at one of the numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (see \figref{fig:ncert/10/15/1/12/my_label}), and these are equally
likely outcomes. What is the probability that it will
point at:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
8?
\item 
an odd number?
\item 
a number greater than 2?
\item 
a number less than 9?
\end{enumerate}
