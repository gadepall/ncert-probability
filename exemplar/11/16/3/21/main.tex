The number of ways to arrange 7 people is $7!$ and the number of ways to arrange 7 people in which the two particular people are adjacent to each other is $6! \times 2$ considering both of them as one unit and considering the arrangements within the unit. Thus,
\begin{align}
    p = \frac{6! \times 2}{7!}
    = \frac{2}{7}
\end{align}
