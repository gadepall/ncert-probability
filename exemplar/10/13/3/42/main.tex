Let
\begin{table}[H]
	\label{Defining variables}
	\input{exemplar/10/13/3/42/tables/table.tex}
	\end{table}
	\fi
If $n^2$ is the value of the chosen number that is greater than 500 and also a perfect square, then
\begin{align}
n^2 \in (500,1000] \\
\implies n \in (22.36,31.62]
\end{align}
$n$ can take 9 integer values in the above interval.
If $A, B$ represent the first and second player winning a prize respectively, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\begin{align}
               \pr{A} = \frac{9}{1000}
\end{align}
\item 
Given that the first player has won, the second player has only 8 numbers left to choose.  Hence, 
\begin{align}
\pr{B|A}=\frac{8}{1000}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
