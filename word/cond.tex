at a city hospital. The probabilities of surgeries rated as very-complex, complex,
routine, simple or very-simple are respectively, 0.15, 0.20, 0.31, 0.26, .08. Find
the probabilities that a particular surgery will be rated

	\item One urn contains two black balls (labelled B1 and B2) and one white ball. A
	second urn contains one black ball and two white balls (labelled W1 and W2).
	Suppose the following experiment is performed. One of the two urns is chosen
	at random. Next a ball is randomly chosen from the urn. Then a second ball is
	chosen at random from the same urn without replacing the first ball.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the probability that two black balls are chosen?
	
	\item What is the probability that two balls of opposite colour are chosen?
