The CDF of the random variable $X$ representing the roll of a dice, is available in \eqref{eq:dice_xiF}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The set of possible prime numbers in a die roll contains 2,3,5
\begin{align} 
\pr{X \in \{2,3,5\}} &= p_{X}\brak{2} + p_{X}\brak{3} + p_{X}\brak{5}\\
&= \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}
\item The probability that a number greater than or equal to 3 will appear is given by
\begin{align}
\pr{X \geq 3} &= 1 - \pr{X \leq 2}\\
&= 1 - F_{X}\brak{2}\\
&= \frac{2}{3}
\end{align}
\item The probability that a number less than or equal to 1 will appear is given by
\begin{align}
\pr{X \leq 1} &= F_{X}\brak{1}\\
&= \frac{1}{6}
\end{align}
\item The probability that a number greater than 6 will appear is given by
\begin{align}
\pr{X > 6} &= 1 - \pr{X \leq 6}\\
&= 1 - F_{X}\brak{6}\\
&= 0
\end{align}
\item The probability that a number less than 6 will appear is given by
\begin{align}
\pr{X < 6} &= \pr{X \leq 5}\\
&= F_{X}\brak{5}\\
&= \frac{5}{6}
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
